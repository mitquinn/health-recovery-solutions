# Health Recovery Solution Coding Challenge
## By Mitchell Quinn

### Goals
* @see route-test.md for complete instructions.
* Create a "Routing Class".
* Use modern php, best practices, and good design.
* "Routing Class" should be able to handle incoming requests along with invoking Controller::Method.
* Bonus points if you have POST.
* Should be able to handle nested/unnested routes.

### Feedback
* One of the more interesting coding challenges I have done recently
* I believe my code satisfies all the requirements.
* It has full test coverage, feel free to use the phpunit.xml.dist
* Add in a mock up application for testing. @see tests/Application/ApplicationTest for general usage.
* I took a few liberties with some of the functionality. I wanted to try out a couple of different ideas. 


### Installing
* Clone the Repo
* Composer install (requires PHP7.4)

### Running tests
* vendor/bin/phpunit
